# 🚀 LeetCode Daily Grind – Mastering DSA One Day at a Time

> 💡 “Consistency is what transforms average into excellence.”

Welcome to my daily commitment to mastering Data Structures & Algorithms! This repository is where I document my journey of solving **LeetCode problems every single day** — not just solving them, but deeply understanding and implementing **optimized** and **interview-ready** solutions.

---

## 📌 Why This Repo?

As a passionate software engineer, I believe DSA is not just for cracking interviews — it's about writing **efficient**, **clean**, and **scalable** code. This repo reflects:
- My **dedication to consistency**
- My approach to **analyzing problems deeply**
- My effort to **sharpen problem-solving skills** daily


✅ Each solution includes:
- Clean and readable code (C++/Java/Python – depending on the day)
- Comments explaining edge cases and optimizations
- Thought process and techniques in the code files or comments
